# University Project - Galactic Defense
A project from my second year of university as part of a games programming module. For this assignment, it was required to make a game making use of a self developed Vector2D class such that a ships movement was controlled via adding forces. For this game, I chose to make a randomly generating level based game with a combination of special and standard stages. While, from a game design point of view, the game is underdeveloped; it was created to meet the specific criteria of the assignment.

### Controls
